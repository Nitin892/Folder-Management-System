# Folder-Management-System

This is a Python script that defines a class FolderStructure which implements a folder system using a binary search tree. The FolderNode and FileNode classes represent nodes in the tree that can either be folders or files, respectively.

The FolderStructure class has methods to create folders and subfolders, print the names of all folders and subfolders within a folder, and set passwords for folders. The __set_password method is a private method that is used to set a password for a folder node.

The __get_folder and __search_folder methods are helper methods that are used to search for a specific folder node within the tree structure. The __traverse_sub_folders and __traverse_folders methods are helper methods that are used to traverse the tree and print the names of all subfolders and folders, respectively.

Overall, this implementation provides a basic framework for managing folders and files in a binary search tree structure.
